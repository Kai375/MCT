# MCT
# Rudimentary MCT project. Made with Java.

# This is an older project of mine made in BlueJ, the easiest way to open it is with BlueJ and clicking the 'BlueJ Project File' that is within the project directory, or pass it to your IDE.  

# Project description:

This is a program that implements a multiple-choice questionnaire (MCT). Each question will have four possible answers, only one of which is correct.

The program will work as follows:

* The program will read the Q&A database from a file. The file is prepared in which each question consists of five lines: The first line represents the question, the second      line represents the answer, and the next three lines are incorrect answers. NOTICE: Opening the file may trigger an unusual condition that requires treatment.

* The program will display one question at a time with the possible answers and allow the user to mark/select the correct answer. The answers will be displayed in random order.

* After the user selects an answer, he will click on the 'Submit' button and the program will check the question and display the user with a message whether the selected         answer is correct or not.

* In addition, a 'Next' button will be displayed, allowing the user to move on to the next question.

* At the end of the test, a final score will be displayed, which will be calculated as the percentage of questions that received the correct answer.

* At the end of the test, the user will be able to start the questions from the beginning.
